Hey world,

I'm Daniel Oizumi, and I've been deep in the world of WordPress and WooCommerce development for over a decade now. My focus? Building websites that aren't just functional, but are truly high-performance, secure, and built to scale. I've had the chance to work with all sorts of clients – from agencies and startups to bustling e-commerce businesses, often based in the U.S. market.

## What keeps me busy?

Think of it as bringing complex web ideas to life, specifically within the WordPress/WooCommerce ecosystem. That usually involves:

-   **Building custom solutions:** Crafting unique plugins and themes exactly to spec, from a blank canvas.
-   **Diving deep into WooCommerce:** Whether it's tweaking the checkout flow, integrating with APIs, setting up dynamic pricing, or tackling other e-commerce challenges.
-   **Performance & Security:** I'm a stickler for speed and making sure sites are locked down tight.
-   **API Integrations:** Connecting WordPress and WooCommerce sites to various external services, including standard REST APIs and other 3rd-party services.
-   **AI Integrations for WP/WC:** Integrating AI APIs into WordPress and WooCommerce environments, focusing on specific applications such as **audio transcription**, **metadata extraction**, and **enhancing chat support features**.
-   **Structured Content:** Making the backend easy to use with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for clean, manageable content.
-   **Writing clean code:** Always aiming for well-structured, testable code that future-proofs projects.

## Tools of the Trade:

My toolkit typically includes:

-   PHP • WordPress Core • WooCommerce
-   JavaScript (plain old JS + jQuery) • HTML • CSS • SCSS
-   REST APIs • MySQL • Git • CI/CD workflows
-   ACF • Composer • Webpack/Gulp
-   And working with hosting environments like AWS • WP Engine • Digital Ocenan • Kinsta • Linux • Apache • Nginx • Cloudflare • DDEV

## Curious to see some code?

Check out the [Oizumi-WP-Challenge](https://github.com/DanielOizumi/Oizumi-WP-Challenge) on my GitHub. It's a custom WordPress mu-plugin and theme project designed to showcase a clean structure, custom post types, ACF implementation, and shortcode rendering.
